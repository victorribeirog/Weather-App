## README for Weather App

### Project Overview
The **Weather App** is a web application designed to provide users with current weather information. This application fetches weather data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

### Features
- **Current Weather**: Displays the current weather conditions for a specified location.
- **Weather Forecast**: Provides a weather forecast for the upcoming days.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Note
**Important**: The project is currently not functioning at 100% due to the fact that the external APIs used for fetching weather data have become paid services. As a result, you may encounter issues while trying to retrieve weather information.
